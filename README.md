SkyNet Watch is built with Express, mySQL2, Sequelize, and Handlebars to give users the real-time ability to
create posts that are displayed on the activites page. Users can interact with other posts by commenting or clicking a reaction button,"Like" or "Dislike".

After creating your account, you can create a post that will be visable on the homepage. You are now able to edit or delete your post. You can keep track of your post by clicking the "My Activites" button.

Once your neighbors join, everyone can create posts to the page. Build an online community with your neighbors by creating post of upcoming events, commenting on a recent suspicious activity - all in real time.
